Language(s) used:
- Python3

In this module, two programs were coded: pdb_fasta_splitter.py and nucleotide_statistics_from_fasta.py. The former takes a file containing both amino acid sequence as well as secondary structure data and splits them into two separate files that retain their respective headers. The latter takes a fasta file and calculates statistics for each sequence which is then used to generated a tab separated file. Additionally, test suites for each programs were generated: test_pdb_fasta_splitter.py and test_nucleotide_statistics_from_fasta.py.
