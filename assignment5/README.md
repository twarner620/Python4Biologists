In this assignment, one program was coded: gene_information_query.py. A module, my_io.py, that opens a file with a specified method, which was implemented each time a file had to be opened in main program.  A module, config.py generated custom error strings, created a dictionary of host keywords for data sanitzation, and returns the absolute path and file extension for the unigene data files. gene_information_query.py takes user input to identify a list of tissues in which a gene of a particular organism are expressed. The list is printed to STDOUT.

Additionally, test suites for my_io.py and config.py were generated: /tests/unit/test_my_io.py and tests/unit/test_config.py
